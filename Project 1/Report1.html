            <p>
			The project description covered most of the information we needed in order to design the ChocAn software.
			We made some assumptions on the critical actors for each use case, intending to be as thorough as possible
			so that all necessary parties were included. The glossary was produced as the project description was read 
			and updated as our understanding of the project grew. The use cases were roughly made while reading as well,
			and then they were completed. Then after all the use cases were created and fully described, the project 
			description was reread so as to assure that all necessary features were included. Each use case is featured 
			in the html, separated by black lines. The Main Success Scenarios were implemented using a combination of 
			ordered and unordered lists. Bitbucket was used to share the workload and maintain an up to date and collaborative 
			codebase. This was essential for sharing ideas for the report.html file and allowing each team member to contribute.
